# Welcome to CatZoo!

This is a silly project that we (Jordan, Will, and Nico) built for our Human-Computer Interaction class at the University of Florida. The project purpose was simply to have product to run user testing and interviews with. The class's focus is on the studying the interaction between users and products. This entails conducting a user study where we have the user complete a number of tasks and we record statistics and take notes on how long it took to do tasks, how many clicks, the amount of errors, and other things of that nature. With this data we will complete a statistical analysis and then use the results to improve on our design from an interaction standpoint. 

Disclaimer: This was built in just under two days...don't hate lol.
